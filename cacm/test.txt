An Algorithm for Solving a Special Class
of Tridiagonal Systems of Linear Equations
.W
An algorithm is presented for solving a system
of linear equation Bu=k where B is tridiagonal 
and of a special form.  It is shown that this algorithm
is almost twice as fast as the Gaussian elimination 
method usually suggested for solving such systems. 
In addition, explicit formulas for the inverse and 
determinant of the matrix B are given.

On Coordination Reduction and Sentence Analysis
.W
A class of coordination phenomena in natural
languages is considered within the frame work
of transformational theory.  To account for these phenomena
it is proposed that certain machinery be
added to the syntactic component of a transformational
grammar. This machinery includes certain rule
schemata, the conditions under which they are to be
applied, and conditions determining the sequence
of subtrees on which they are to be performed.  A solution
to the syntactic analysis problem for this
class of grammars is outlined.  Precise specification
of both the generative procedure of this paper
and its inverse is given in the form of LISP function definitions.
